    "1. Research the data set online and write a summary about it in your README.\n",
    "2. Download the data set and add it to your repository.\n",

    "**Introduction:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Fisher's Iris data set is a famous data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936. The data set consists of measurements on the length and width of sepals and petals of three varieties of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 50 samples for each species, making a total of 150 samples. The measurements are in centimeters and consist of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set is often used for statistical analysis, visualization, and machine learning algorithms, such as classification and clustering. It is also used as a benchmark data set for evaluating new methods and algorithms.\n",
    "Fisher's Iris data set is considered a classic example of exploratory data analysis and is widely used in data science education and research.\n",

    "This project was an excellent learning experience for me and was of great worth in my data analytics journey. I found most elements acheivable but challenging and found the more the project progressed the more ideas I began to come with and considered more ways to make the code more neat or the output more substantial. Within the Readme file I have included how to run the code and what to expect when one does. I have also described how to interpret the data being presented. In hindsight, I believe this code could become more fluid and believe there are ways to shorten it and make it more substantial and efficient. I also believe I could have included more visualisation. These considerations I will bring forward in my journey thought programming and data analytics."
