A data analysis project looking at Fisher's Iris Dataset

Fisher's Iris data set is a famous multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936. The data set consists of measurements on the length and width of sepals and petals of three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

There are 50 samples for each species, making a total of 150 samples. The measurements are in centimeters and consist of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The data set is often used for statistical analysis, visualization, and machine learning algorithms, such as classification and clustering. It is also used as a benchmark data set for evaluating new methods and algorithms.

Fisher's Iris data set is considered a classic example of exploratory data analysis and is widely used in data science education and research.
